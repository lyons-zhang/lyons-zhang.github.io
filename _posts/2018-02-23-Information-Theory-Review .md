    The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.

>  The characterization of the channel capacity (the logarithm of the number of distinguishable signals) as the maximum mutual information is the central and most famous success of information theory.   
  
### **Discrete Memoryless Channels**    
The heart of the communication problem is **discrete** in nature: the transmitter sends one out of a finite number of codewords and the receiver would like to figure out which codeword is transmitted.
