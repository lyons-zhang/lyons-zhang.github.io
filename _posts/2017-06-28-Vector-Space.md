>  Linear algebra is the study of linear maps on finite-dimensional vector spaces. Use of vectors to represent a countably infinite sequence is a small conceptual extension. Viewing waveforms as vectors is a larger conceptual extension. We have to view vectors as abstract objects rather than as n-tuples. Orthogonal expansions are best viewed in vector space terms. 

### **Axioms of vector space**
A vector space V is a set of elements, $$\vec v \in \upnu$$, called vectors, along with a set of rules for operating on both these vectors and a set of ancillary elements called scalars.   
##### **Addition**


##### **Scalar multiplication**

##### **Distributive laws**
