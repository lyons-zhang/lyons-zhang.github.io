>  Nyquist’s Criterion specifies the conditions on $$g(t) = p(t)*p^*(−t)$$ for an ISI-free channel on which a symbol-by-symbol detector is optimal.   
  
### **Ideal Nyquist waveform**    
The demodulator first filters the received modulated waveform $$u(t) = \sum_k u_k p(t-kT)$$ using a filter with impulse response $$q(t)$$. It then samples the output at $$T$$-spaced sample times. That is, the received filtered waveform is   
<center>$$r(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} u(\tau) q(t - \tau) d\tau = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_k u_k p(\tau - kT) q(t - \tau) d\tau =  \sum_k u_k g(t - kT) \tag{*}$$</center>
and the received samples are $$r(T), r(2T), . . . ,$$.
There is **no intersymbol interference** if $$r(kT) = u_k$$ for each integer $$k$$, and from (*) this is satisfied if $$g(0) = 1$$ and $$g(kT) = 0$$ for each nonzero integer $$k$$.   
A waveform $$g(t)$$ is **ideal Nyquist** with period $$T$$ if $$g(kT) = \delta(k)$$.  
If $$g(t)$$ is ideal Nyquist, then $$r(kT) = u_k$$ for all $$k \in \mathcal Z$$. If $$g(t)$$ is not ideal Nyquist, then $$r(kT) \neq u_k$$ for some $$k$$ and choice of $${u_k}$$.   
### **The Nyquist criterion**
Let $$s(t)$$ be the baseband-limited waveform generated by the samples of $$g(t)$$,
<center>$$s(t) = \sum_k g(kT) sinc({t \over T} − k)$$</center>
$$g(t)$$ is ideal Nyquist iff $$s(t) = sinc(t/T)$$ i.e., iff $$\hat s(f) = T rect(fT)$$   
From the aliasing theorem,
<center>$$\hat s(f) = l.i.m. \sum_m \hat g(f + {m \over T}) rect(fT)$$</center>
**Nyquist criterion** : Let $$\hat g(f)$$ be $$L^2$$ and satisfy the condition $$\lim\limits_{|f|\to \infty} \hat g(f)|f|^{1+\varepsilon} = 0$$ for some $$\varepsilon > 0$$. Then the inverse transform, $$g(t)$$, of $$\hat g(f)$$ is ideal Nyquist with interval $$T$$ if and only if $$\hat g(f)$$ satisfies the Nyquist criterion for $$T$$, defined as
<center>$$ l.i.m. \sum_m \hat g(f + m/T) rect(fT) = T rect(fT)$$</center>
This says that out of band frequencies can help in avoiding intersymbol interference.   
The frequency $$\omega = \pi / T$$ or $$f = 1/2T$$ is called the **Nyquist Frequency**.
##### **Band-edge symmetry**
The choice of $$\hat g(f)$$ involves a tradeoff between making $$\hat g(f)$$ smooth, so as to avoid a slow time decay in $$g(t)$$, and reducing the excess of $$B_b$$ over the Nyquist bandwidth $$W_b$$. This excess is expressed as a rolloff factor, defined to be $$(B_b/W_b) − 1$$, usually expressed as a percentage.   
The most widely used set of functions that satisfy the Nyquist Criterion are the **raised-cosine shapes**, which simply rounds off the step discontinuity in $$rect({f \over 2W_b})$$ in such a way as to maintain the Nyquist criterion while making $$\hat g(f)$$ continuous with a continuous derivitive, thus guaranteeing that $$g(t)$$ decays asympototically with $$1/t^3$$.
